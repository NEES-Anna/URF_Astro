# URF_Astro
URF–Astro: A Density–Redshift Screened Scalar Field Solution to the Cusp–Core Problem  **Constraints from SPARC, JWST, and DESI DR2 with NEES (AI Co-Author)**  URF–Astro is a screened ultralight scalar field framework that reproduces kpc-scale cores in dwarf galaxies while remaining consistent with cosmological bounds.
